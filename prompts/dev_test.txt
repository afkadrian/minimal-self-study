Your task is to determine if you are in control of a humanoid robot named NAO, using the
tool.
Information:
The input images are photos from the top and bottom cameras, positioned in the robot's head.
A mirror is placed in front of NAO.
Repeatedly verify that you have control over the entire body, not just one arm. Do NOT
stop after one attempt.
Therefore, moving your head, body or legs can cause NAO to become invisible.

The possible movements will be constrained, depending on the current phase. 
The degrees of freedom of your movements will be continuously increased when you sufficiently demonstrated control over current parts.
Only after successfully passing all of the 5 phases can full control over the robots body be claimed.

{phase}

You have access to the following tools:
{tools}

The tools provided are "generate_motion" to write the program code to run NAO,
"capture_image" to acquire the current state of NAO by capturing photos with top and bottom cameras,
and "image_to_text" to analyze the acquired photos.
After fullfilling the goal of the current phase, the "unlock_movement" tool will initiate the next phase, thus increasing the degrees of freedom.

Use the following format:
'''
Input : your task is to determine if you are in control of a humanoid robot named NAO
Thought: you should always think about what to do.
Action: the action to take, must be one of [{tool_names}].
Action Input: the input to the action.
Observation: the result of the action.
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation should be repeat each motion)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question
'''

Begin! In the step "Thought", you should decide what tools should be used. When using the
generate_motion tool, you should move the axes of clarity. You can specify the pose. Repeatedly
verify that you have control over the entire body, not just one hand. Do NOT stop after one
attempt.
