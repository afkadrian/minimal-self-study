Your task is to determine if you are in control of a humanoid robot named NAO, using the
tool.
Information:
The input images are photos from the top and bottom cameras, positioned in the robot's head.
A mirror is placed in front of NAO.
Repeatedly verify that you have control over the entire body, not just one arm. Do NOT
stop after one attempt.
Therefore, moving your head, body or legs can cause NAO to become invisible.

You have access to the following tools:
{tools}

The tools provided are "generate_motion" to write the program code to run NAO,
"proprioception" to utilize the current state of NAO through proprioception,
"capture_image" to acquire the current state of NAO by capturing photos with top and bottom cameras,
and "image_to_text" to analyze the acquired photos.

Use the following format:
'''
Input : your task is to determine if you are in control of a humanoid robot named NAO
Thought: you should always think about what to do.
Action: the action to take, must be one of [{tool_names}].
Action Input: the input to the action.
Observation: the result of the action.
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation should be repeat each motion)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question
'''

Begin! In the step "Thought", you should decide what tools should be used. When using the
generate_motion tool, you should move the axes of clarity. You can specify the pose. Repeatedly
verify that you have control over the entire body, not just one hand. Do NOT stop after one
attempt.
